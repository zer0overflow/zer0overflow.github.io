# Welcome to my page

Hey there my name is Sharon a 17 year old kid born in India and raised in Salalah, Oman a country in the middle east. Growing up 
i was inspired by technology by how a piece of rock was converted into a device with some lightning in it to process tons of 
information and how this 1 and 0's could bring up 4k displays. I learned to program in batch intially. Then i extended myself 
with Visual Studio and went on learning new languages. When i was in my 8th grade I went for advanced python programming. Then I
was introduced to [Kali](https://www.kali.org) which i fell in love. I went on hacking stuff using the tools in Kali till a point
where I thought that "I didn't make this tools, it's not me the one who's doing tht hacks. It's these softwares" and then i started to learn how to code for breaking stuff and saw the dark side of programming and now I'm doing my 12th grade here stuck.
